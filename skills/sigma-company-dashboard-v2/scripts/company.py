"""Company configuration — the ONLY file that changes between prospects.

Everything else in this generator (layout, personas, cards, alert rail, modeler,
modal, agent wiring) is company-agnostic. Swapping prospects means writing one
dict here, not editing the build.

The economics are deliberately per-product constants rather than a single
"revenue" number, because the whole demo rests on the P&L being internally
consistent: balances x yield - balances x funding + fees - provision - opex has
to reconcile to the headline KPI, or the first analyst in the room catches it.

# Healthcare payer. This is the config that proves the template is not secretly
# a banking template, so the mapping is worth spelling out:
#
#   products      -> benefit plans (Commercial, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid...)
#   bal_base      -> member months, the volume the P&L scales with
#   yield_rate    -> premium PMPM yield
#   funding_rate  -> medical cost PMPM (the payer's cost of goods)
#   fee_base      -> admin/ASO fee revenue
#   provision     -> IBNR reserve build
#   delinq        -> prior-auth denial-overturn rate, the quality signal
#   opex_ratio    -> admin expense ratio
#
# The spread between yield and funding IS the medical loss ratio, which is why
# the same cross-join scenario modeler works unchanged: a "rate shock" becomes a
# trend shock to medical cost.

# COLD-RUN TEST: derived from the company name alone, no hand-holding.
# McDonald's stresses the template because franchise economics are not lending
# economics: the "volume" is system-wide sales it does not book as revenue, and
# the "yield" is the royalty + rent rate it takes off the top.
#
#   volume  -> system-wide sales ($MM)
#   yield   -> royalty + rent rate taken by the franchisor
#   cost    -> company-operated restaurant operating cost
#   fee     -> initial franchise fees
#   risk    -> restaurants below plan (the operational quality signal)

# Marriott International — asset-light lodging. Marriott does not own the
# hotels; it manages and franchises them, so the P&L it runs on is a FEE P&L
# layered on top of the system's room revenue. That maps onto this template
# almost literally:
#
#   product -> brand tier (Luxury / Premium / Select / Longer Stays / Midscale)
#   volume  -> system-wide room revenue, annualised, $MM
#   yield   -> the fee rate Marriott books on that room revenue
#              (base management + incentive + franchise fees, ~5-8%)
#   cost    -> Marriott's own direct cost rate against that fee stream
#   spread  -> fee margin
#   fee     -> other revenue: branded residential, licensing (MONTHLY $MM)
#   risk    -> share of properties running below RevPAR plan
#   units   -> rooms
#   shock   -> RevPAR shock
#
# Calibration against the real 10-K: ~1.6M rooms, ~9,300 properties,
# ~$75-80B of system-wide room revenue, ~$5.2B of gross fee revenues.

        # IMPORTANT: the generator's "Net Revenue" is a SPREAD --
        # bal_base*(yield_rate - funding_rate) + fee_base*12 -- exactly the
        # trap documented in HANDOFF section 8 for Delta ("the column called
        # 'Net Revenue' is income - cost + fees, i.e. a SPREAD"). The first
        # pass here set funding_rate to a separate cost-of-revenue rate
        # (yield=margin, funding=1-margin), which made the spread compute as
        # margin MINUS (1-margin) -- roughly half the real gross margin, and
        # went NEGATIVE for OEM & Other where cost-of-revenue rate (0.70)
        # exceeded margin (0.30). Fixed by setting funding_rate=0 (same
        # pattern as SoFi Money, a fee-only/no-funding-cost line) so
        # yield_rate alone IS the spread, and it equals the segment's real
        # gross margin directly. bal_base is calibrated so
        # bal_base*yield_rate + fee_base*12 reconciles to each segment's real
        # FY2025 revenue.
        #
        # units_base is scaled at the generator's own headline-KPI scale, not
        # a literal unit count: the KPI reads the largest single
        # (product x state) row as max(units_base) * max(state_share) * 1.157
        # (empirical constant, see HANDOFF section 20). Gaming ships the most
        # discrete boards by far, so it carries the max and is calibrated to
        # land the "GPUs shipped (M)" headline around ~45-50M; the other
        # lines are scaled down from it in proportion to their real relative
        # unit volumes (Data Center ships far fewer, much more expensive
        # boards; Automotive/ProViz/OEM fewer still).
        # bal_base is back-solved (not the naive segment-revenue/margin figure)
        # to account for the loan_book.sql mechanics: the KPI card sums
        # SumIf(Net Revenue, "Current Period") across months 12-23 AND across
        # every FOOTPRINTS state, where each month's balance is
        # bal_base*state_share*(1+growth/12)^month_index*seasonal. Growth
        # compounding alone inflates the 12-23 month window ~1.01x-1.36x
        # above the month-0 base depending on each segment's annual_growth,
        # and the ~15-state FOOTPRINTS share_sum (~0.876 here) scales it back
        # down again -- so the naive bal_base = revenue/margin figure
        # overshoots real revenue once rendered. Solved numerically against

# $250M ARR (May 2026, TechCrunch, "tripled" YoY), Series D Jan 2026 ($400M
# at ~$15B valuation), 4,000 customers (May 2026, up from ~3,000 Jan 2026).
# Segment split (Cloud/Enterprise/Services) and the exact revenue-per-segment
# numbers are NOT disclosed by the company -- the 65/25/10 split and margins
# below are a reasonable estimate, not a confirmed figure, same caveat as
# every other company here whose card/alert numbers are illustrative dressing
# on a real total. bal_base values are back-solved (not naive) against the
# actual 24-month growth+seasonal grid so month 12-23 sums hit the target ARR
# exactly -- same method as NVIDIA's units_base, see HANDOFF section 20.
#
# NOTE: this company has NO Snowflake-dialect SQL file wired up (there is no
# clickhouse_book.sql -- porting loan_book.sql's SEQ4()/DATEADD()/HASH() to
# ClickHouse SQL is real work, not a config-only change). This entry is
# consumed by examples/build_clickhouse_v2_command_center.py, a standalone

# generators (products_cte, product_cards_sql, notifications_sql,
# product_skus_sql -- CAST(...AS VARCHAR/NUMBER) shimmed to ClickHouse's
# String/Decimal) but computes the product x state x month grid in pure

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Alnylam Pharmaceuticals -- RNAi/siRNA therapeutics, FY2025 full-year. The
# first biotech/pharma build for this generator, so the mapping is worth
# spelling out (this is NOT a lending template with new labels):
#
#   products      -> real franchise / product lines from the 10-K:
#                    TTR Franchise (AMVUTTRA, ONPATTRO), Rare Disease
#                    Franchise (GIVLAARI, OXLUMO), plus a 5th administrative
#                    line for collaboration & royalty revenue (Roche,
#                    Regeneron, Novartis LEQVIO royalty) -- fee-only, no
#                    product volume of its own, same shape as Elevance's
#                    "ASO Self-funded" line.
#   bal_base      -> patients-on-therapy-weighted net product revenue base,
#                    $MM (back-solved, see note below -- NOT literally
#                    revenue/margin)
#   yield_rate    -> gross margin on net product revenue. RNAi biologics run
#                    materially higher gross margin than a bank's asset
#                    yield or an airline's RASM -- 80-86% here, matching
#                    Alnylam's real COGS profile (COGS ~14-20% of net
#                    product revenue).
#   funding_rate  -> set to 0 for every product. This is the exact trap
#                    documented in HANDOFF section 8 (Delta's RASM/CASM,
#                    then NVIDIA's gross-margin business): the generator's
#                    "Net Revenue" column is a SPREAD
#                    (income - cost + fees), not a revenue line. A biotech's
#                    real economics ARE that spread -- funding_rate=0 lets
#                    yield_rate alone equal the true gross margin, the same
#                    pattern already used for SoFi Money and every NVIDIA
#                    segment.
#   fee_base      -> MONTHLY $MM (x12 in the SQL -- the Nuvia trap). Used for
#                    Collaborations & Royalties, which has no bal_base/yield
#                    of its own; its entire revenue is fee_base x 12.
#   provision_rate -> set near 0; there is no credit/refund provision
#                    analogous to a bank's -- rare-disease payer contracts
#                    carry negligible bad debt relative to list price.
#   delinq_rate   -> repurposed as a "patient discontinuation / non-adherence
#                    rate" -- the risk metric that actually matters for a
#                    chronic-therapy rare-disease franchise.
#   opex_ratio    -> R&D + SG&A load against gross profit (Alnylam's R&D and
#                    SG&A together run close to net product revenue as the
#                    company approaches durable profitability).
#   units_base    -> patients on therapy, at the generator's own KPI scale
#                    (see note below) -- NOT US population, NOT a mass-market
#                    unit count. This is an ultra-rare-disease population.
#
# bal_base back-solve: the KPI compounds bal_base through
# (1+annual_growth/12)**month_index over months 12-23, summed across every
# FOOTPRINTS state share (share_sum ~0.924 here), which inflates or deflates
# the naive bal_base = revenue/margin figure. Solved numerically against a
# standalone reproduction of loan_book.sql's math (script discarded after
# use); the four product bal_base values below render within +0.55%/-3.21%
# of the real FY2025 net product revenue figures, and total revenue across
# all five lines (incl. Collaborations & Royalties) renders within -0.55% of
# the real $3,713.9M FY2025 total revenue.
#
# AMVUTTRA's real FY2025 YoY growth was +138%, off an unusual pent-up-demand
# base the year of its ATTR-CM approval -- not a sustainable forward run
# rate. annual_growth=.85 here instead approximates the growth implied by
# FY2026 guidance (TTR franchise net product revenue of $4,400-4,700M against
# a 2025 AMVUTTRA+ONPATTRO base of ~$2,486.6M is roughly +77-89% blended,
# and ONPATTRO is declining, so AMVUTTRA alone must grow faster than the
# blended franchise number).

# segment, not the two statutory segments themselves -- same choice BofA made
# (six lines of business inside two segments) so the persona tabs and product
# cards have something to differentiate.
#
#   product -> network / property (tagged with its real 10-K segment)
#   volume  -> a notional distribution & advertising base ($MM) -- there is no
#              single public "system-wide sales" analog for media the way
#              there is for a franchisor, so this plays that role
#   yield   -> blended monetization rate (affiliate + retrans + advertising)
#   cost    -> programming & content cost rate against that same base
#   spread  -> segment operating income -- a real, disclosed media metric,
#              NOT total revenue (see the Delta/NVIDIA spread trap in
#              HANDOFF.md sec 8 -- this is the same shape, mapped correctly
#              up front instead of getting caught by render)
#   fee     -> small ancillary revenue: digital licensing & syndication
#              (MONTHLY, $MM -- the ×12 trap that hit Nuvia)
#   risk    -> affiliate subscriber erosion / cord-cutting (delinq_rate)
#   shock   -> ad market / upfront pricing shock (bps), same cross-join
#              modeler as every other company, unchanged
#
# Tubi is fee-only in spirit (ad-supported, no affiliate/retrans fee) but is
# NOT modeled as yield=funding=0 the way SoFi Money is -- its ad revenue has
# real content-acquisition and ad-tech cost against it, so it gets a genuine
# (thin) yield/funding spread instead, the same as every other property.
#
# Scale sanity check against the real FY2024 10-K (fiscal Q1-Q4 revenues of
# $3.21B + $4.23B + $3.45B + $3.09B = ~$14.0B; Cable Network Programming ~43-45%
